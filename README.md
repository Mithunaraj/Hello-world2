# Hello-world2
Re-learning about GitHub after an year by creating a repo called Hello-world2

Learning about GitHub as I'm on bench and wanted to utilise this time updating my skillset. 
Started to learn Python from Jose Portilla (Udemy course - Complete Python Bootcamp) and in one of his chapter he mentioned/showed the basics of GitHub. 

Hopefully I will start using GitHub regularly :) As this will help in future as most automotive developers are using GitHub for their code.
